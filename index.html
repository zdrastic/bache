					<h3>Investment Management Services</h3>
					<p>Bache Standard Capital portfolio management service is geared towards clients who wish to participate and take an active interest in their investments but realize they would benefit from supervision and supplementary guidance. Our financial analysts identify bourgeoning investment opportunities through algorithms they feel would be suited to a client's portfolio. They must adhere to strict regulatory oversite and obtain fiduciary authorization before they can go forward and execute an investment decision.</p>
					<p>They are available to provide professional advice in instances where clients may not be sure about opportunities or financial products they have identified through their efforts:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>A fully qualified financial strategist will identify investment opportunities.</li>
						<li>These opportunities will always factor into a client's risk aversion and objectives.</li>
						<li>Clients can request and implement stipulations that investments are not to be made in industries they consider unethical; pharmaceuticals, armaments, munitions, tobacco, etc.</li>
						<li>Our Investment professionals are on hand to discuss and converse about any investment strategies clients may have.</li>
						<li>Pre IPO Market Listings</li>
						<li>Live Stock Trading Analysis</li>
						<li>Broker Consultation</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Product Allocation</h3>
					<p>Bache Standard Capital's discretionary portfolio management services have proven immensely attractive to those clients who prefer to be kept up-to-date with their investments but do not possess the knowledge or acumen to manage their portfolios effectively. Often, this is owing to a lack of time or, perhaps, a preference for other activities like family or retirement.</p>
					<p>Our comprehensive investment services can be tailored to match your requirements, investment goals, and time-sensitive pre-IPO investments. For example, a growth portfolio can be structured and tailored to provide regular redemptions, such as to pay for a youth's tuition or additional income to supplement an annuity.</p>
					<p>A qualified financial strategist will manage investments that the client authorizes to make investment decisions on their behalf:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The financial strategy will be in keeping with the client's objectives and risk-averse profile.</li>
						<li>There is a little lag between making the investment decision and executing it.</li>
						<li>Clients have unrestricted access to portfolio managers and financial strategists who can discuss all issues or inquiries.</li>
						<li>Documentation concerning asset equities or other assets held within a client's portfolio is maintained in a nominee account, minimizing risk</li>
					</ul>
